âœ… When to choose MySQL (SQL Database)

	2.	ACID transactions needed â†’ Banking, finance, or any system where data consistency is critical.
	3.	Fixed schema â†’ You know the fields in advance (like name, email, salary).
	4.	Complex queries & joins â†’ Reporting, analytics, or dashboards where you run multi-table queries.
	5.	Well-established ecosystem â†’ Lots of tools, support, and mature community.

	3.	Nested / unstructured data â†’ User profiles, comments, logs, IoT sensor data.
	4.	Fast reads/writes â†’ Especially for non-transactional workloads.
	5.	Agile development â†’ You donâ€™t want to spend time designing strict schemas early.

ðŸ“Œ Example use cases:
	â€¢	Social media apps (posts, likes, comments â†’ flexible & fast).
	â€¢	Real-time analytics or logging.
	â€¢	Content management systems.
	â€¢	Location-based apps (storing geospatial data).
