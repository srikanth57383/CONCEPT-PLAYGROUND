// 📝 Pro-Level Answer (Simple English, Interview-Ready)

// “When I start a new project, I break my planning into three parts: frontend, backend, and database.

// 🔹 Frontend (React)
// 	•	I first design the UI and component structure — making components reusable and organizing the project feature-wise.
// 	•	For state management, I decide based on complexity: React Context for small apps, Redux Toolkit or React Query for larger apps.
// 	•	I also plan routing with React Router or Next.js if SEO and SSR are needed.
// 	•	Finally, I think about performance: code splitting, lazy loading, and responsive design.

// ⸻

// 🔹 Backend (Node.js + Express)
// 	•	I plan the API structure (REST APIs, or GraphQL if required).
// 	•	I set up authentication and authorization (usually JWT-based).
// 	•	I decide how to handle error logging, input validation, and security from day one.
// 	•	If the project is large, I follow a layered architecture (controllers, services, models) to keep code clean.

// ⸻

// 🔹 Database (SQL vs NoSQL)
// 	•	I choose the database based on the data type and relationships.
// 	•	If the project needs structured data with relationships (like finance, ERP, or reporting apps), I prefer SQL databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
// 	•	If the project deals with flexible or unstructured data (like user profiles, chats, content-heavy apps), I prefer NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
// 	•	I also design indexes and schemas to make sure the database performs well as the app grows.
