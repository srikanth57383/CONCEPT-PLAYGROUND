🚀 Complete Overview: React Buffering & Concurrent Rendering

1. Virtual DOM (VDOM)
	•	React uses a Virtual DOM: a lightweight copy of the real DOM.
	•	When state changes:
	1.	React creates a new VDOM tree.
	2.	Compares (diffs) with the previous VDOM tree.
	3.	Finds the minimal changes needed.
	4.	Applies them to the real DOM.
	•	Limitation (pre-React 16): This diffing was synchronous and blocking. Big updates froze the UI.

👉 Interview note: “React introduced VDOM for efficiency but it wasn’t enough for smooth UIs when rendering big updates.”

2. Fiber Architecture (React 16)
	•	Fiber = new reconciliation engine (2017).
	•	Each component is represented by a Fiber node (a JS object with props, state, effects, etc).
	•	Key advantage: React can split rendering into small units of work.
	•	Work can be:
	•	Started
	•	Paused
	•	Resumed
	•	Abandoned

👉 Interview note: “Fiber was introduced so React can break long tasks into chunks, allowing the browser to stay responsive.”

⸻

3. Scheduler
	•	React has a scheduler (separate package) to decide which work to do first.
	•	Assigns priorities:
	•	Immediate → Clicks, input events.
	•	User-blocking → Typing, animations.
	•	Normal → UI updates, data rendering.
	•	Low → Preloading data, background work.
	•	Idle → Non-critical tasks.

👉 Interview note: “The scheduler ensures urgent user interactions always go first.”

⸻

4. Concurrent Rendering (React 18)
	•	With Fiber + Scheduler, React can now do Concurrent Rendering:
	•	Render phase is interruptible (can pause/resume/discard).
	•	Commit phase is synchronous (always applies changes immediately).
	•	Example: While rendering a huge list, if user types, React pauses rendering and updates input immediately.

👉 Interview note: “Concurrent rendering doesn’t make React faster, but makes apps feel faster by prioritizing urgent updates.”

⸻

5. Buffering
	•	Buffering = holding back non-urgent updates until urgent ones finish.
	•	APIs:
	•	startTransition → Mark some updates as low priority.
	•	useDeferredValue → Let React delay rendering derived values.
	•	Example: Search box with 10,000 items
	•	Typing (query) → Urgent, updates immediately.
	•	Filtering (results) → Buffered until typing finishes.

👉 Interview note: “Buffering keeps UI responsive by not blocking urgent updates with heavy tasks.”

⸻

6. Commit Phase
	•	Once work is ready, React commits updates:
	•	Applies changes to the real DOM.
	•	Runs useLayoutEffect (before paint).
	•	Runs useEffect (after paint).
	•	Important: Commit phase is always synchronous.

⸻

7. DOM Update
	•	Browser paints changes on the screen.
	•	User sees:
	•	Input value updating instantly (urgent).
	•	Results updating with slight delay (buffered).

⸻

📊 Example Timeline: Typing in a Search Box
	1.	User types “a” → React synthetic event.
	2.	setQuery(“a”) → High priority update (urgent).
	3.	setResults(filteredList) inside startTransition → Low priority (non-urgent).
	4.	Scheduler runs urgent first → Input updates immediately.
	5.	Non-urgent work buffered → Filtering happens later.
	6.	Commit phase flushes → Results update in DOM.

🎯 Interview-Ready Summary

If interviewer asks:
“How does React handle a user typing in a search box while rendering a huge list?”

You can say:

“React first captures the user’s input event through its synthetic event system. The state update is sent to the Fiber tree, where React creates a new work-in-progress render. The scheduler assigns priorities: typing is urgent, list filtering is non-urgent. Thanks to Fiber and concurrent rendering, React can pause rendering the list and immediately update the input field. The heavy list update is buffered using startTransition or useDeferredValue, and React flushes it later in the commit phase. This ensures the UI stays responsive. The commit phase itself is always synchronous — once React decides to commit, DOM updates happen in one batch.”

✅ With this, you’ve covered:
	•	VDOM (what changed).
	•	Fiber (how work is split).
	•	Scheduler (who decides priority).
	•	Concurrent Rendering (interruptibility).
	•	Buffering (delaying non-urgent updates).
	•	Commit Phase (sync updates).
	•	DOM (final paint).
