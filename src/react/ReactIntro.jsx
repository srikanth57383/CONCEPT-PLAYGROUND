// ðŸ”¹ 1. What is React? Why is it popular?

// âœ… What is React?

// React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs).
// It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the DOM using a virtual DOM.

// 	â€¢	Developed by Facebook in 2013.
// 	â€¢	Based on a component-based architecture..

// âœ… Why is React considered better than other libraries?

// React became popular because it solves performance, maintainability, and scalability problems that developers faced with older libraries like jQuery or AngularJS.
// 	â€¢	Virtual DOM improves performance by updating only the changed parts of the UI.
// 	â€¢	Component-based approach helps split the UI into reusable pieces.
// 	â€¢	Unidirectional data flow makes debugging and state management predictable.
// 	â€¢	Hooks allow powerful features like state, lifecycle, and side-effects inside functional components.
// 	â€¢	Rich ecosystem: React Router, Redux, React Query, etc.


//    Feature.              |     Benefit
//--------------------------------------------
//   Virtual DOM.          |     Fast UI updates

//   Component-Based.      |     Reusable, maintainable code

//   JSX.                  |     Clear, readable UI code

//   Hooks.                |     Cleaner functional code with powerful features

//   One-Way Data Flow.    |     Predictable and easy-to-debug applications

//   Strong Community.     |     Tons of resources, support, job opportunities

//   Cross-Platform.       |     Use React Native for mobile development



// ðŸ”¹ 2. What is SPA (Single Page Application)?

// âœ… What is a Single Page Application?

// A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web app that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content without reloading the entire page.

// React apps are SPAs by default.
// 	â€¢	Only the first request loads the full HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
// 	â€¢	After that, React handles page changes client-side using routing.
// 	â€¢	This creates a faster, smoother user experience, like a native app.



// âœ… How does routing work in SPAs?
// 	â€¢	React uses React Router to manage navigation without page reloads.
// 	â€¢	Instead of navigating to a new HTML file, it updates the URL and renders the right component.
// 	â€¢	React Router listens for URL changes and matches them to defined routes.



// âœ… What is JSX in React?

// JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
// Itâ€™s not required, but itâ€™s the most common way to build UIs in React.
