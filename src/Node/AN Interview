Node.js interview questions often cover a range of topics, from fundamental concepts to more advanced architectural considerations and best practices.
Fundamental Concepts:
What is Node.js and its core principles? Explain its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model and how it leverages the V8 JavaScript engine.
Explain the Event Loop in Node.js. Describe its role in handling asynchronous operations and managing callbacks.
What are callbacks and how do they work in Node.js? Discuss their use in asynchronous programming and potential issues like "callback hell."
What are Promises and how do they improve upon callbacks? Explain their states and how they provide a more structured approach to asynchronous code.
What is npm and its purpose? Explain its role as a package manager and its functionalities for managing project dependencies.
Explain module.exports and exports in Node.js. Differentiate their usage in defining and exporting modules.
What is REPL in Node.js? Describe its functionality as a Read-Eval-Print Loop.
Intermediate Concepts:
What are streams in Node.js?
Discuss their types (Readable, Writable, Duplex, Transform) and their benefits for handling large data.
Explain the concept of middleware in Express.js.
Describe its role in processing requests and responses in a web application.
Differentiate between setImmediate(), setTimeout(), and process.nextTick() in the Event Loop.
Explain their execution order and use cases.
How do you handle errors and exceptions in Node.js applications?
Discuss error-first callbacks, try-catch blocks, and error handling middleware.
What is the purpose of package.json?
Explain its key fields and how it manages project metadata and dependencies.
Advanced Concepts and Best Practices:
How does clustering work in Node.js?
Explain its use for leveraging multi-core CPUs and improving application scalability.
Discuss best practices for securing Node.js applications.
Cover topics like input validation, authentication, authorization, and protecting against common vulnerabilities.
How do you handle database interactions in Node.js?
Discuss connecting to databases (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and using ORMs/ODMs.
Explain how to optimize the performance of a Node.js application.
Discuss techniques like caching, load balancing, and preventing Event Loop blocking.
Describe different approaches to testing Node.js applications.
Cover unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing frameworks.
How do you manage environment variables in Node.js?
Discuss techniques for configuring applications for different environments.
