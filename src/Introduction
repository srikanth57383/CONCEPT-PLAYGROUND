<!-- 📝 Self-Introduction (Interview-Ready)

**“Thank you for the opportunity. My name is Srikanth, and I have around 4 years of experience as a Full Stack Developer specializing in the MERN stack. I work with React.js on the frontend, Node.js and Express on the backend, and MongoDB for databases.

One of my key projects was DigiCafe, where I built a digital café platform with features like order management, payment integration, and responsive UI. I handled both frontend and backend, focusing on performance and user-friendly design.

Another project was a Warehouse Management System, where I developed modules for inventory tracking, order processing, and role-based access. I designed efficient database structures and implemented APIs to handle large data with reliability.

Along with development, I have exposure to DevOps practices. I can write Dockerfiles, manage Git workflows, and set up CI/CD pipelines to deploy applications on AWS EC2.

Overall, I am passionate about building scalable, high-performance applications and I am eager to contribute my skills to your team.”** -->
